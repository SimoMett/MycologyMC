# Mycology
Mycology is a Minecraft 1.21.3 mod for NeoForge that provides a breeding system for mushrooms. You can find new fungi all of the world (and dimensions), each with it's unique characteristics.

Some of them can be cooked in a furnace or distilled in a brewing stand, but the fun part (at user discretion) is combining between them to hopefully get an interesting and usefull (or very bad and toxic) mutation.

This mod is obviously inspired by the glorious [Forestry](https://github.com/ForestryMC/ForestryMC), which I enjoyed a lot playing with when I was younger.

## Dev notes
Branch 'dev' is for development, 'master' for release.
