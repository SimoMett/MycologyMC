# Mycology
[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/DonSimonetti/MycologyMC/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DonSimonetti/MycologyMC/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

Mycology is a Minecraft 1.21.3 mod for NeoForge that provides a breeding system for mushrooms. You can find new fungi all of the world (and dimensions), each with it's unique characteristics.

Some of them can be cooked in a furnace or distilled in a brewing stand, but the fun part (at user discretion) is combining between them to hopefully get an interesting and usefull (or very bad and toxic) mutation.

## Dev notes
Branch 'dev' is for development, 'master' for release.
## TODO
### Generic
- [X] Get the NBT tags working
- [X] Make a data model to be stored in each mushroom (species, temperature, humidity, soil type, effects, ecc...)
- [X] Datapack support
- [X] Ability to plant mushrooms (to be polished)
- [X] A LOT of species. [This fantastic tool](https://github.com/SimoMett/mushroom_renderer) can help ;)
- [ ] Edit mushroom spreading mechanic (partial)
- [X] Implement breeding
- [X] Implement crafting mechanics
### Area effects and particles
- [X] Implement fungus spores' area effect
- [X] Emitting particles
- [X] Create a nice looking sporing particle
### Natural world generation
- [X] Add natural generation in the world (to be polished)
- [X] Make some mushroom spawn only in certain biomes (consistently with their environment requirements)
- [X] Assign one or two species for each biome (except the arid ones)
